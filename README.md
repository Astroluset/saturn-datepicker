# Material range datepicker
Material datepicker with range support
## What is this?

This is a based on Material source code (March 22, 2018) implementation of Material Datepicker for Angular.
I created this repository and this package due to it takes a lot of time to contribute to material2 repository.
[Issue in material2 repo.](https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/4763)

5) Supports input from keyboard
6) Supports keyboard handling

## It's awesome, but how to use it?

As easy as pie.
Installation: `yarn add saturn-datepicker` or `npm install saturn-datepicker`
Import `SatDatepickerModule`, `SatNativeDateModule` and `MatDatepickerModule`
```angular2html
  <mat-form-field>
    <input matInput [satDatepicker]="resultPicker">
    <sat-datepicker
        #resultPicker
        [rangeMode]="true">
    </sat-datepicker>
   </mat-form-field>
```

Add styles:
* If you are using CSS: copy-paste or include somehow the file `saturn-datepicker/bundle.css`
* If you are using SCSS (preferable): 
```scss
@import '~saturn-datepicker/theming';
@include sat-datepicker-theme($theme); # material theme data structure https://material.angular.io/guide/theming#defining-a-custom-theme
```

## ngModel/formControl value have this interface:
```typescript
export interface SatDatepickerRangeValue<D> {
  begin: D | null;
  end: D | null;
}
```

### How to change date format or locale?
As same as for material, but with more code, just import constants from 'saturn-datepicker'.

Also you need to install `@angular/material-moment-adapter` package.
```
import { DateAdapter, MAT_DATE_FORMATS, MAT_DATE_LOCALE, SatDatepickerModule } from 'saturn-datepicker'
import { MAT_MOMENT_DATE_FORMATS, MomentDateAdapter } from '@angular/material-moment-adapter'


@NgModule({
    imports: [
        SatDatepickerModule,
    ],
    providers: [
        MyReportsService,
        {provide: DateAdapter, useClass: MomentDateAdapter, deps: [MAT_DATE_LOCALE]},
        {provide: MAT_DATE_FORMATS, useValue: MAT_MOMENT_DATE_FORMATS},
    ],
})
export class MyModule {
}

For advanced formatting, please look through material documentation.
